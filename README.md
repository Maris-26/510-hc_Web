TECHIN 510 B Sp 25: Programming For Digital And Physical User Interfaces

1. Project Objectives
-- Collect and organize DIY cocktail recipes from publicly available online sources into a structured, searchable format.
-- Develop a responsive web interface that allows users to search, filter, and view cocktail recipes based on ingredients, alcohol type, or flavor profile.
-- Implement a feature for users to input available ingredients and receive matching cocktail suggestions.

2. Parget users and their needs
-- Home cocktail enthusiasts：Need simple, easy-to-follow recipes to make drinks with ingredients they already have.
-- Beginner mixology learners：Need guided instructions, visual clarity, and drink ideas for building their skills.
-- Casual users hosting social events：Need quick suggestions for popular or themed cocktails that fit their available ingredients and occasion.

3. Key deliverables
-- Curated cocktail recipe dataset：A structured collection of at least 100 cocktail recipes sourced from public websites.
-- Searchable and filterable web interface：A responsive browser application that allows users to explore recipes by ingredients, alcohol type, or flavor.
-- Ingredient-matching recommendation feature： A tool that suggests recipes based on user-input available ingredients.

4. Special constraints (e.g., regulatory compliance)
-- Recipes and images will only be collected from publicly available sources that allow reuse or will be clearly cited.
-- The site will focus on recipe discovery and will avoid promoting alcohol consumption, in line with student project and institutional guidelines.

6. Expected outcome
-- The final system will enable users to discover, filter, and learn how to make cocktails based on their preferences or available ingredients, with a focus on usability and interface quality.
